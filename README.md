Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository is a Tleugaisha Ospanova submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.
Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
Files
•	CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
•	run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition:
o	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
o	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
o	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
o	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
o	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
•	FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.

Review criteria
•	The submitted data set is tidy. 
•	The Github repo contains the required scripts. 
•	GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information. 
•	The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable. 
•	The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.
